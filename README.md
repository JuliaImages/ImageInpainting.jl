Image inpainting algorithms in Julia.

For those situations where we need to remove undesired elements from the scene...

**Obs:** Currently, only single channel N-dimensional images are supported. For example, `zeros(100,100)` and `zeros(50,50,50)` are valid 2D and 3D input images. `zeros(100,100,3)` is *not* a 2D image with 3 channels.

## Installation

Get the latest stable release with Julia's package manager:

```julia
Pkg.add("ImageInpainting")
```

## Usage

```julia
using ImageInpainting

# inpaint image within mask using algorithm
inpaint(img, mask, algo)
```
