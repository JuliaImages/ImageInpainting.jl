Image inpainting algorithms in Julia.

For those situations where we need to remove undesired elements from the scene...

**Obs:** Currently, only single channel images are supported.

## Installation

Get the latest stable release with Julia's package manager:

```julia
Pkg.add("ImageInpainting")
```

## Usage

```julia
using ImageInpainting

# inpaint image within mask using algorithm
inpaint(img, mask, algo)
```
where `mask[i,j,...]` is set to `true` whenever a pixel is to be inpainted.

Examples of usage for each algorithm can be found in the test folder.
